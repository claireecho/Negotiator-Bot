# ü§ñ Recruiter Bot

A smart AI-powered recruiter bot that presents job offers and negotiates with candidates using OpenAI's GPT API. The bot evaluates negotiation attempts and can improve offers for deserving candidates or decline unreasonable requests.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smart Negotiation**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo to evaluate candidate negotiations
- **Dynamic Offers**: Three-tier offer system (Entry, Mid, Senior level positions)
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive web interface for seamless conversation
- **Professional UI**: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
- **Offer Management**: Visual display of current offers with benefits and salary ranges
- **Intelligent Responses**: Bot can improve, maintain, or decline offers based on negotiation quality
- **User-Friendly Setup**: No environment variables needed - enter your OpenAI API key directly in the web interface

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (get one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd recruiter-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**

   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The app will be running locally on your machine

5. **Enter your OpenAI API key**

   - When you first visit the app, you'll see a field to enter your OpenAI API key
   - Enter your API key (starts with `sk-`) and click "Save API Key"
   - Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers
   - Once saved, you can start negotiating with the recruiter bot!

## üåê Deployment Options

### Local Development

The app runs locally on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Cloud Deployment

You can deploy this application to various cloud platforms:

- **Heroku**: Add a `Procfile` with `web: gunicorn main:app`
- **Railway**: Connect your GitHub repository
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Deploy directly from GitHub
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Use their respective container services
- **Docker**: Create a Dockerfile for containerized deployment

### Environment Variables for Production

Make sure to set these environment variables in your deployment platform:

- `PORT`: Port number (usually set automatically by the platform)

**Note**: Users will enter their OpenAI API keys directly in the web interface, so no server-side API key configuration is needed.

## üéØ How It Works

### Initial Offer Generation

- The bot randomly selects from four official job offer levels:
  - **New Grad**: New Grad Software Engineer ($75,000)
  - **Entry Level**: Software Engineer I ($85,000)
  - **Mid Level**: Software Engineer II ($105,000)
  - **Senior Level**: Senior Software Engineer ($130,000)

### Negotiation Process

1. **User starts conversation** ‚Üí Bot presents a firm, realistic job offer
2. **User negotiates** ‚Üí Bot evaluates using GPT API with strict criteria
3. **Bot responds** with one of three actions:
   - **Improve**: Upgrade to higher level or add benefits (only for compelling arguments)
   - **Maintain**: Keep current offer (most common outcome)
   - **Decline**: End negotiation (for unreasonable/unprofessional requests)

### GPT Evaluation Criteria

The bot acts like a real recruiter and only improves offers when candidates demonstrate:

- **Exceptional Skills**: Experience beyond role requirements
- **Strong Negotiation**: Logical reasoning and professional communication
- **Specific Value**: Clear benefits they bring to the company
- **Market Research**: Knowledge of industry rates and standards

**Examples of Good Negotiations:**

- "I have 8 years of React experience and led a team of 5 developers. I also have AWS certifications valuable for this role."
- "Market research shows senior developers with my microservices expertise typically earn $130,000-$150,000. I bring expertise that could save the company significant development time."

**Examples of Bad Negotiations:**

- "I need more money"
- "This offer is too low"
- "Can you increase the salary?"

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask web framework
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Deployment**: Any Python hosting platform (Heroku, Railway, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### Key Files

- `main.py` - Main Flask application with bot logic
- `templates/index.html` - Web interface
- `static/css/style.css` - Styling and responsive design
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application page
- `POST /start_conversation` - Initialize bot conversation
- `POST /negotiate` - Handle user negotiation attempts
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint

## üé® Customization

### Adding New Offer Levels

Edit the `JOB_OFFERS` dictionary in `main.py`:

```python
JOB_OFFERS = {
    "your_level": {
        "title": "Your Job Title",
        "salary": "$X,XXX - $Y,YYY",
        "benefits": ["Benefit 1", "Benefit 2"],
        "description": "Job description"
    }
}
```

### Modifying Bot Personality

Update the `system_prompt` in the `evaluate_negotiation` function to change:

- Bot's communication style
- Evaluation criteria
- Response format

### Styling Changes

Modify `static/css/style.css` to customize:

- Colors and gradients
- Layout and spacing
- Animations and transitions
- Responsive breakpoints

## üîß Environment Variables

| Variable | Description                        | Required |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `PORT`   | Port for Flask app (default: 8080) | No       |

**Note**: The OpenAI API key is now entered directly in the web interface, so no environment variables are needed for the API key.

## üì± Usage Tips

### For Candidates

- **Be Professional**: Maintain respectful, business-like communication
- **Provide Evidence**: Back up requests with specific skills, experience, or market data
- **Research Market Rates**: Know industry standards for your role and experience level
- **Highlight Value**: Explain how your skills benefit the company specifically
- **Be Specific**: Instead of "I want more money," say "Based on my 5 years of React experience and team leadership, I believe I qualify for the senior level"
- **Show Enthusiasm**: Express genuine interest in the role and company
- **Be Reasonable**: Understand that most negotiations result in maintaining the current offer

### For Recruiters

- Monitor conversation logs for insights
- Adjust offer levels based on company needs
- Customize evaluation criteria for different roles

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API key is required" or "Invalid API key format"**

   - Make sure you've entered your OpenAI API key in the web interface
   - Ensure your API key starts with `sk-` and is at least 20 characters long
   - Get a valid API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

2. **"Error processing your message"**

   - Check your OpenAI API quota and billing
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check application logs for detailed error messages

3. **Styling not loading**
   - Ensure `static/css/style.css` exists
   - Check Flask static file configuration
   - Clear browser cache

### Debug Mode

The app runs in debug mode by default. To disable:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider rate limiting for production use
- Validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks

## üìà Future Enhancements

- [ ] User authentication and session management
- [ ] Conversation history persistence
- [ ] Multiple job categories and industries
- [ ] Advanced analytics and reporting
- [ ] Integration with HR systems
- [ ] Multi-language support

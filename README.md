# ü§ñ Recruiter Bot

A smart AI-powered recruiter bot that presents job offers and negotiates with candidates using OpenAI's GPT API. The bot evaluates negotiation attempts and can improve offers for deserving candidates or decline unreasonable requests.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Negotiation**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo to evaluate candidate negotiations with realistic recruiter behavior
- **Real Company Offers**: Personalized offers from actual tech companies (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Airbnb, Stripe, etc.)
- **Professional PDF Generation**: Download detailed offer letters as PDFs that match your exact offer
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Negotiations become more challenging with each attempt - first try is moderate, subsequent attempts are much stricter
- **Company Preservation**: Offers maintain the same company and position throughout negotiations - only compensation improves
- **Change Explanations**: Clear explanations of what specifically changed in improved offers
- **Four-Tier System**: New Grad, Entry, Mid, and Senior level positions with appropriate compensation and benefits
- **Real-time Chat**: Interactive web interface for seamless conversation
- **Professional UI**: Modern, responsive design with smooth animations and collapsible offer display
- **Offer Management**: Visual display of current offers with company branding, benefits, equity, and signing bonuses
- **Intelligent Responses**: Bot can improve, maintain, decline, or withdraw offers based on negotiation quality and attempt number
- **Offer Withdrawal**: Bot can withdraw offers for unprofessional, demanding, or disrespectful behavior
- **User-Friendly Setup**: No environment variables needed - enter your OpenAI API key directly in the web interface

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (get one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd recruiter-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Access the application**

   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
   - The app will be running locally on your machine

5. **Enter your OpenAI API key**

   - When you first visit the app, you'll see a field to enter your OpenAI API key
   - Enter your API key (starts with `sk-`) and click "Save API Key"
   - Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers
   - Once saved, you can start negotiating with the recruiter bot!

## üåê Deployment Options

### Local Development

The app runs locally on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

### Cloud Deployment

You can deploy this application to various cloud platforms:

- **Heroku**: Add a `Procfile` with `web: gunicorn main:app`
- **Railway**: Connect your GitHub repository
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Deploy directly from GitHub
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: Use their respective container services
- **Docker**: Create a Dockerfile for containerized deployment

### Environment Variables for Production

Make sure to set these environment variables in your deployment platform:

- `PORT`: Port number (usually set automatically by the platform)

**Note**: Users will enter their OpenAI API keys directly in the web interface, so no server-side API key configuration is needed.

## üéØ How It Works

### Initial Offer Generation

- The bot randomly selects from four official job offer levels:
  - **New Grad**: New Grad Software Engineer ($75,000)
  - **Entry Level**: Software Engineer I ($85,000)
  - **Mid Level**: Software Engineer II ($105,000)
  - **Senior Level**: Senior Software Engineer ($130,000)

### Negotiation Process

1. **User starts conversation** ‚Üí Bot presents a firm, realistic job offer
2. **User negotiates** ‚Üí Bot evaluates using GPT API with strict criteria
3. **Bot responds** with one of three actions:
   - **Improve**: Upgrade to higher level or add benefits (only for compelling arguments)
   - **Maintain**: Keep current offer (most common outcome)
   - **Decline**: End negotiation (for unreasonable/unprofessional requests)

### GPT Evaluation Criteria

The bot acts like a real recruiter and only improves offers when candidates demonstrate:

- **Exceptional Skills**: Experience beyond role requirements
- **Strong Negotiation**: Logical reasoning and professional communication
- **Specific Value**: Clear benefits they bring to the company
- **Market Research**: Knowledge of industry rates and standards

**Examples of Good Negotiations:**

- "I have 8 years of React experience and led a team of 5 developers. I also have AWS certifications valuable for this role."
- "Market research shows senior developers with my microservices expertise typically earn $130,000-$150,000. I bring expertise that could save the company significant development time."

**Examples of Bad Negotiations:**

- "I need more money"
- "This offer is too low"
- "Can you increase the salary?"

```python
JOB_OFFERS = {
    "your_level": {
        "title": "Your Job Title",
        "salary": "$X,XXX - $Y,YYY",
        "benefits": ["Benefit 1", "Benefit 2"],
        "description": "Job description"
    }
}
```

### Modifying Bot Personality

## üîß Environment Variables

| Variable | Description                        | Required |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| `PORT`   | Port for Flask app (default: 8080) | No       |

**Note**: The OpenAI API key is now entered directly in the web interface, so no environment variables are needed for the API key.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"API key is required" or "Invalid API key format"**

   - Make sure you've entered your OpenAI API key in the web interface
   - Ensure your API key starts with `sk-` and is at least 20 characters long
   - Get a valid API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

2. **"Error processing your message"**

   - Check your OpenAI API quota and billing
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check application logs for detailed error messages

3. **Styling not loading**
   - Ensure `static/css/style.css` exists
   - Check Flask static file configuration

### Debug Mode

The app runs in debug mode by default. To disable:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False)
```

## üí° Negotiation Tips

### ‚úÖ Good Negotiation Examples:

- "I have 5 years of experience in React and led a team of 3 developers at my previous company, plus I have AWS certifications"
- "I have competing offers from Google for $120k and Microsoft for $115k respectively"
- "I bring specialized skills in machine learning that directly match your AI initiatives"

### ‚ùå Poor Negotiation Examples:

- "I want more money"
- "I think I deserve better"
- "Can you increase the salary?"
- "I'm really good at coding"

### üö´ Withdrawal-Worthy Examples (will result in offer withdrawal):

- "This is insulting, I deserve way more than this"
- "You're being cheap, I know you can afford more"
- "This is pathetic, I expected better from [company name]"
- "I'm not accepting anything less than $200k"
- "You're making a mistake if you don't give me what I want"
- "I have other offers, you better match them or I'm gone"

### üéØ Strategy:

- **First attempt**: Be specific about your value and experience
- **Second attempt**: Provide concrete evidence of competing offers or unique skills
- **Third+ attempts**: Only try if you have exceptional qualifications - the bot becomes very strict
